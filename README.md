# Basket-Grasps
Calculating basket grasps of 2D polygonal objects, measuring basket depth using graph search algorithm for single and continuous curve of grasps.
Originally only capable of computing depth of singular basket grasp, using file 'ComputeBGDepth_Single'
Added capability to compute depth of basket grasp sets, using the file 'ComputeBGDepth_Curve'. 
At the moment still somewhat buggy around singular states, work in process to clear issues.

To draw a new object to simulate, use file 'Object_drawer'.
